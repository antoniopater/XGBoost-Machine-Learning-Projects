Project Overview:

This project uses a dataset containing blood test results and associated health conditions. 
BloodGuard processes these results and builds a machine learning model capable of diagnosing health conditions. 
The core functionality includes:

Loading and preprocessing blood test data.

Training and predictive model using the XGBoost classifier 

Making predictions basen on new blood test results

Measuring model accuracy to evaluate performance
